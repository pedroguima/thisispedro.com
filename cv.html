	<h2>Testimonies</h2>

	<p><i>"Pedro is excellent at solving problems, even ones you don't know you have, and can do that with panic reigning around him while he calmly sorts out what's wrong and puts it right. And once he's done it, he doesn't stand around taking bows, he just gets on with whatever's next."</i></p>

	<p><i>"Pedro is a very focused person. He is also very pleasant to work with."</i></p>
